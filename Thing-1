The purpose of this file is to enable a collaborative conversation about chosing the first of our 23 things about openness.

##Thing 1: Undecided 

#Ideas
##The Nature of Openness as a Fundamental Condition
### Description
Although openness might be an inherent good, it is difficult to quantify and monetize.  That is, it is difficult to sell the notion on economic grounds at universities. After all, we have a long tradition of having a large and talented community of scholars whose principal activates include gathering, integrating, creating, and sharing knowledge artifacts (course materials). We have historically shared and used liberally within the community and as long as each scholar, teacher, student, and researcher appropriately attributes the work of others, there is little problem with using content for educational purposes. Yes, the publishers might have a different perspective, but once again, discovery and enforcement of legal breaches that are culturally acceptable are difficult. 

All that said, openness is about more. Unfortunately openness advocates have  frequently been asked, or feel compelled, to defend openness (open access, open textbook, open source software, open educational resources, open educational opportunities, etc.) as if it were a product quality. In some cases it is, and the cases in which it is most easily described as a meaningful characteristic of a product is when it relates to something that is published and its costs can be distributed. Other applications of openness are more difficult to defend or rationalize, such as open education more broadly or simply adopting qualities of openness within an organization. 

In such cases, we must really think about openness as a fundamental or foundational condition from which to build other qualities of known value. We might argue that two such characteristics are a) agility and b) collaboration. That is agile practice and collaboration are not possible to achieve over a non-trivial period of time without openness.

### Learning Objectives
Articulate the value of openness relative to agility

Articulate the value of openness relative to collaboration

###Practice Outcomes
Develop a method for identifying additional Openness Topics

Develop a way to enhance the usefulness of Topic Sessions for use, reuse, and modification.

Build practice for conversation as pedagogy

Build practice that models open principles and values supporting agile and collaborative learning and teaching 

###Base Activities / Conversation Starters
Expressions of Openness: Examples of Open Practice

Openness Index: https://wiki.jasig.org/display/2398/Openness+Index 
The Index is developed on three levels a) Values, b) Principles, and c) Objectives. It seems to me that the values are qualities an organization must nurture and individuals must practice to establish an “Open Culture.” They tend to be attitudes and dispositions. The principles are actions that are most successful when the values of openness are practices. The principles require some organizational support of infrastructure. The objectives reflect the behaviors of agile management and governance. This provides some relationships between openness and agility. Note that collaboration is mentioned as a principle that leads to agility.
